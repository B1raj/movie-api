# movie-api

Below are the things that I would have done in this application, if had more time. Having said that it does not impact any functionality of the application.
1. I would have used an end 2 end reactive stack.
2. I would have used a global code to impose javax validations at Request bean level.
3. Used method level interceptors for logging request and responses along with uuid.
